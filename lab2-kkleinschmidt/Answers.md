###What is the complexity of each of the 4 search methods in terms of array or list size n?

Linear for the first three search methods and binary for the last search method.

###What happens in the case of binary search if the array is not sorted?

If the array is not sorted the binary search, it woudln't function properly becuase the program might not find the correct portions of the array that is being looked for.

###What is the purpose of constructor argument validity checking?

The validity checking is done to ckeck for the value if it is null or not, if it is null it will tell you it is invalid 

###What is the purpose of using the keyword final with variables and arguments?

Final correctness ensures the user does not modify the arguments, once they are declared final they cannot be overridden or have any values changed.

###What are alternatives to using Optional and how do they compare?

Instead of using `Optional` you can write your own conditions to check for null refrences.
